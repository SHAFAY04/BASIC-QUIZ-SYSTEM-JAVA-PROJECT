# BASIC-QUIZ-SYSTEM-JAVA-PROJECT
this is a basic quiz system being created on java it is still incomplete and under creation!
to take a look at the current version of my project the zip file extract it and open the whole project folder with any situable IDE (intelliJ/netbeans etc) and then just compile and run the "homepage.java" file and you're good to go :)
note that this project has still a lot to implement and a lot of features to be added!
